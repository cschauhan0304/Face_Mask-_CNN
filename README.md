# ðŸ˜· Face Mask Detection using CNN

A deep learning project that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not in real-time using images or video streams.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a deep learning model capable of distinguishing between people **with masks** and **without masks** using a CNN. This is crucial in the current context of public health surveillance and safety enforcement.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset used is a labeled collection of face images from:

ðŸ“¥ [Face Mask Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omkargurav/face-mask-dataset)


- Total images: ~1,375
- Preprocessing:
  - Resized to 128x128
  - Normalized pixel values
  - Converted to grayscale (optional)

## ðŸ§  Model Architecture

The model is a simple but effective **CNN** built using Keras with the following layers:


âœ… Binary Classification: 0 - Without Mask | 1 - With Mask

## ðŸ“Š Model Performance

- **Training Accuracy**: ~98%
- **Validation Accuracy**: ~97%
- **Loss**: Converges within 10â€“15 epochs
